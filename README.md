# GouskosLab Project Summary (January 2024 - Present)

## Graph-Based Deep Neural Network for k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Visualization

This repository contains an implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch Geometric, along with a method for visualizing k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs using NetworkX and Matplotlib. The project is built in Python and can be executed in Google Colab or a local environment with GPU support.

## Features
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Implementation**: Utilizes GCNConv layers for effective graph representation.
- **kNN Graph Visualization**: Visualize k-nearest neighbor graphs using NetworkX for intuitive understanding of data relationships.
- **Custom Data Generation**: Generate synthetic datasets or use your own dataset for flexibility in experimentation.
- **Training and Evaluation Pipeline**: Complete pipeline with the capability to visualize graph structures during the training process.

## Particle Identification with Teacher Model

This project also explores particle identification by leveraging a teacher model to enhance resolution accuracy. The teacher model provides high-quality guidance during training, allowing the student model to learn more effectively from complex datasets. This dual-model approach significantly improves the identification performance of particles in challenging scenarios, enabling more precise classifications based on graph representations.
