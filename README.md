# Graph-Based Deep Neural Network for k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Visualization

This repository contains an implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch Geometric, along with a method for visualizing k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs with `networkx` and `matplotlib`. The project is built in Python and can be executed in Google Colab or a local environment with GPU support.

## Features

- Implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with `GCNConv` layers.
- Visualization of k-nearest neighbor graphs using `networkx`.
- Custom data generation or use your own dataset.
- Training and evaluation pipeline with visualization of graph structures.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gnn-knn-visualization.git
cd gnn-knn-visualization
